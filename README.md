## Highlighted Features
### Gaps
What are you looking for now days! I have modified all layout to have gaps its not like `gaps` or `uselessgap` that tried to change multiple things with one thing. I added each layout to have correct gapping behaviour like what I want. Even you could toggle the gap with `^P`.

If you are not meme person you can use `nogaps` branch that has no gaps code in it.

### Magic-Grid
Layout that always fill the space even though the number of windows are odd or prime. The binding for this layout is `^G`.
